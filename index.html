    <p>
      Everywhere you look, people are quitting their jobs and other people (mostly corporate executives) are trying to figure out why.
      But it’s not hard to get to the core of what’s causing The Great Resignation.
    </p>
    <h2>The research</h2>
    <p>
      Recently published data from The Pew Research Center reveals the main reasons people are quitting. Topping the list are low pay, no opportunity to advance, and feeling disrespected.
      Other issues include a need for (or lack of) childcare, zero flexibility, and poor benefits.

    <h2>The issues</h2>
    <p>
      These issues are nothing new, but it seems like workers are experiencing a kind of collective epiphany that’s happening across all industries and business sectors.
      People are deciding they don’t want to deal with all the crap anymore.
